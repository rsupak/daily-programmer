*Closest Palindrome*
Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.

The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.

```Input: "123"
Output: "121"

Input: "99800"
Output: "99799"

Input: "10"
Output: "9"```
The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer. (edited)
